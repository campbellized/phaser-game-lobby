#Phaser Game Lobby
This is a proof of concept using MeteorJS 1.2.1 and the Phaser game engine. The idea is to create a multiplayer game where users can play co-operatively (or competitively) while chatting. Multiplayer is currently not implemented, but I'm working on that.

#To-Dos
- Add multiplayer
